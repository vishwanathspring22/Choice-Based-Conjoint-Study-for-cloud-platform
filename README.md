# Choice-Based-Conjoint-Study-for-cloud-platform
An academic project in Marketing analytics, in this the dataset is based on a cloud platform which consists of attributes like cloud storage, cloud services and price with a choice set of alternatives. 

For this project you will run a Choice-Based Conjoint study in the Cloud Services Platform
market (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). The client wants to
make some product design decisions such as core feature-sets, pricing, and tiers of service
to optimise revenue or new sign-ups.
You will work with the cloud.csv file. The file contains data on choices made by 200
respondents. Each respondent evaluated 15 choice sets. Thus, the file contains data on 200
× 15 = 3000 choice sets. Each choice set had three alternatives. A respondent’s task was to
choose one alternative from a choice set. The choice set being chosen according to the influence from the attibutes is done using logistic regression.
